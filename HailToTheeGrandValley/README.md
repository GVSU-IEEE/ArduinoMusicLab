Alma Mater Music Box
====================
Copyright 2015 by the Grand Valley State University Branch of the IEEE.

This is a sample project for playing a melody using an Arduino UNO. It is
currently designed to play the Grand Valley State University Alma Mater song,
*Hail to Thee, Grand Valley*, by Arthur C. Hills.

To use the program, connect a piezo buzzer to a digital pin on the Arduino, and
adjust the macro in `HailToTheeGrandValley.ino` accordingly. Then, upload the
program. The song will play once through every time the Arduino is reset or
powered on.
