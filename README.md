Arduino Music Lab
=================
Copyright 2015 by the Grand Valley State University Branch of the IEEE.

This is a pair of related lab projects for playing music using an Arduino UNO.
The first, `HailToTheeGrandValley`, plays the school's Alma Mater on a piezo
buzzer. The second, `ArduinoInstrument`, uses a distance sensor and a piezo
buzzer to create a simple musical instrument.
