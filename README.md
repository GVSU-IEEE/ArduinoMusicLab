Arduino Music Lab
=================
Copyright 2015 by the Grand Valley State University Branch of the IEEE.

This is a pair of related lab projects for playing music using an Arduino UNO.
The first, `HailToTheeGrandValley`, plays the school's Alma Mater on a piezo
buzzer. The second, `ArduinoInstrument`, uses a distance sensor and a piezo
buzzer to create a simple musical instrument.

Detailed program documentation can be generated using Doxygen by simply
executing the `doxygen -g Doxyfile` command within either project directory. The
resulting documentation will be placed in a `Doc` subdirectory.
